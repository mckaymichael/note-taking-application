# BCIT 3294 - Notes Application
- Add documentation below 

I want to:

- have a warning while filling out forms. Stuff like minimum length or, must insert name, etc., only after someone has clicked the 'save' button.

- remove random input box in the delete form

- allow more flexibility for the course number selection. Maybe make it an input that they can save for future notes. So if they type one in, it creates a new option to select it? Sounds challeging. Might not have the time anymore.
